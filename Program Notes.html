      <h1><b>Lesson 1: Basics of the Web</b></h1>
      <div class="L1">
    <h3>How The Web Works</h3>
    <p>The web is a collection of computer the communicate with each other to relay inormation. The computer uses <em>HTTP</em> to ask  <em>servers</em> for a particular webpage or <em>HTML Document</em>.
      </div>
    <br>
      <div class="L1">
      <h3>HTML</h3>
    <p><b>Html</b> is described a the "the heart of the web." Any and all webpages would not exist if not for HTML. HTML itself is made of <em>many</em> individual aspects to keep it together. The actual <b>text content</b> is what is seen and read on the webpage. The <b>markup</b> is how it is displayed on the webpage.</p>
      </div>
    <br>
      <div class="L1">
      <h3>HTML Markup</h3>
    <p>HTML markup is control by elements known as <em>tags</em> and <em>attributes</em>.<b>Tags</b> are used to alter the appearance of specific words or phrases. All tags are used in the middle of a "less than sign" and a "greater than sign". To make a word <b>bold</b>, you would use the "b" tag and to <em>italize</em>, the "em" tag would be used.<b>Attributes</b> are complementary assets to some tags. An anchor tag, for example, would be accompanied by the attribute "href", while "src" or search would be used for an image or "img" tag.</p>
      </div>
    <br>
      <div class="L1">
      <h3>Span and Div</h3>
    <p><b>Span</b> and <b>Div</b> are two classes that are used to contain a specific word or phrase. Div class is a <b>block</b> element, meaning it creates a "box" around the specified word or phrase. Span is an <b>inline</b> element, similar to "a","br","strong",etc.
       </div>

    <h1><b>Lesson 2: Getting Started</b></h1>
     <div class="L1">
    <h3>Learning how to learn</h3>
    <p>Learning how to do anything can be simplified into 4 relatively simple stages. The first stage would be <em>Ignorance</em> or “Stage 0.” 0 is fitting for this stage because you know nothing at this stage. Stage 1 is the <em>Awareness</em> stage, which can be achieved by asking a simple question: What is that? Stage 2 is <em>Ability</em> which is just being able to do something at some level of competency. Stage 3 is <em>Fluency</em>, being able to do something in your sleep.</p>
     </div>
     <br>
     <div class="L1">
    <h3>Leave Mastery to the Masters</h3>
    <p>Fluency is not the current target, but it is still a goal. The current targets are Ability and Awareness. The reasoning is quite simple: the more you know about something and the more you do that, the quicker and easier it is to <em>master</em> it.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="L1">
    <h3>Understanding the Language</h3>
    <p><b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> are both languages that can be looked at as two sides of the same coin. HTML and the tags inside of it control the structure of the page. The structure of the page is what tells the browser what the content is and how to display it: text, picture, tag, etc. It's done by connecting several different elements into a tree-like "structure". CSS controls the style of the page, or the way it looks. The definition of language in this sense is a combination of <b>syntax</b> and <b>rules</b>.</p>

        <h1><b>Lesson 3: CSS Code Style</b></h1>
        <div class="L1">
        <h3>What not to do</h3>
        <p>The first lesson in using CSS is to avoid repetition! CSS standards for <b>Cascading Style Sheet</b>, which roughly translates to a sheet that takes the <em>most descriptive</em> rule that it is given and applies that rule to an html document. CSS sort of acts like a home decorator in a sense that it will customize the webpage to the specifications of the client.  </p>
      </div>
      <br>
        <div class="L1">
        <h3>How CSS works</h3>
        <p>CSS targets a specific class or tag by using a <b>selector</b>. Using a selector tells the CSS to target all classes or tags with this name and changes them according to the given rules. The rules provided to the CSS are <b>declarations</b> made up of a <b>property</b> and a <b>value</b>. </p>
      </div>
      <br>
        <div class="L1">
        <h3>How to use CSS</h3>
        <p>CSS can be used in a number of ways:</p>
         <ol>
          <li>Write it in to the initial HTML file through the in the head element,</li> <li>Link it in as a separate file all together,</li> <li>or Write it in the HTML with the corresponding element by inlining it, which is a bad idea, because it requires repetition for similar elements and that breaks Rule No. 1.</li>
      </ol></div>
